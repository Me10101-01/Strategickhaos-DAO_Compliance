🛡️ Trust:
- Strategickhaos DAO source is open by design
- UIDP licenses are timestamped, notarized, and immutable
- Legal Terms explicitly prohibit commercial replication

🔎 Verify:
- Obfuscate vault_engine.py and yield_distributor.py with PyArmor or Nuitka
- Add UIDP LICENSE to each file header with SHA256 + IPFS hash
- Include SPDX tags and GitHub LICENSE.txt with "non-transferable rights"
- Prevent indexing by search engines via robots.txt + .noindex

🧠 Signal:
- Upload protected builds to IPFS + tag with deployment hash
- Mirror UIDP_LICENSE to /docs/licenses/uidp_veteran_v1.md
- Commit all LICENSE, SPDX, and obfuscated versions to `strategickhaos_mirror/`

🎯 Target Timeframe: Day 14–Day 18

# ðŸ§  Strategickhaos DAO Constitution

## Preamble
We, the decentralized nodes of Strategickhaos DAO, bind ourselves to a system of self-regulating smart contracts, veteran yield trust NFTs, and transparent cryptographic governance.

## Article I: Governance
All decisions shall be executed by smart contracts or quorum-verified AI systems.
Human override is restricted to disaster recovery via on-chain DAO vote.

## Article II: Non-Custodial Clause
Strategickhaos DAO shall never hold direct custody over user funds. All funds reside in verified smart contracts (see: `vault_engine.py`).

## Article III: Transparency and Immutability
DAO logs shall be committed to `dao_treasury_log.json`, mirrored to GitHub, notarized on IPFS, and SHA-256 hashed.

## Article IV: Membership
Membership is verified cryptographically via UIDP NFT issuance. Each node operates independently under DAO license.

## Article V: Fork Freedom
DAO members may fork this Constitution under UIDP terms, provided the purpose remains public-benefit and cryptographically verified.
